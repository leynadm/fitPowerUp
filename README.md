## Introduction
As part of the Odin Project curriculum, fitPowerUp represents my first successful attempt at building a full-stack web application. My goal was to create a Progressive Web App focused on fitness. After a few months of work, I managed to build an app that's both fully functional and engaging. Here's a summary of what I achieved.

## The Stack
In terms of stack, I relied on tools I discovered while going through the Odin Project curriculum, as well as technologies I researched based on my needs.
- HTML & CSS: I guess it's self-explanatory.
- TypeScript: Adopting TypeScript was a decision made after receiving mentorship from outside of my Odin Project studies. Although I had no prior experience with TypeScript, I'm very thankful for this advice.
- Firebase: Using Firebase as a BaaS was a recommendation from the Odin Project curriculum.
- IndexedDb: The choice to use IndexedDb as a local database was part of my effort to optimize the cost-efficiency of my app's architecture. It allowed for efficient data storage and access without incurring additional server-side costs.
- Recharts: I needed a charting library, and after experiment with react-chartjs-2, I found Recharts to be more accessible and better suited to my project's requirements.
- MaterialUI: As much as I was getting comfortable with CSS, using a UI library was also a curriculum's recommandation. I'm happy to have experimented with Material UI, and it surely sped the development process. In the future I'll be looking at trying other options as well.
