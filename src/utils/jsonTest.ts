    routineDescription:
      "The 5/3/1 program for beginners by Jim Wendler is a popular strength training routine focused on gradual progression. It is based on the primary lifts: squat, bench press, deadlift, and overhead press. The program also includes assistance exercises to build muscle and balance. It's designed for beginners to gain strength steadily while minimizing the risk of injury. The key principles are simplicity, slow progression, and consistency.",

After completing the main 5/3/1 sets for the day, you perform 5 sets of 5 reps using the weight from your first set of the day (the "First Set Last"). For example, if you had bench and squats at 85% of your 1RM, you would do 5 sets of 5 reps at this weight after completing the main 5/3/1 sets.\n\nThe idea behind the FSL is to get more volume at a manageable weight, helping to build strength and reinforce good form.',

For the first 2 sets you perform 5 reps, and in the last set AMRAP (As Many Reps As Possible). The last set should not be to absolute muscular failure – try to get a feel for when you have 1-2 reps left in you.",

The primary goal is to be a simple, easy to follow routine that will help beginners get into the gym, start training with the standard barbell lifts, and build a habit of going to the gym consistently. Consistency over time is the biggest point of failure in making progress, and the aim is to lower the barrier as far as possible to starting and staying consistent.",

      "For the T1 & T3 exercises (in this case Squats and Lat Pulldown) the last set should be AMRAP (As Many Reps As Possible).\nEvery session add 5lbs/2.5 kg for bench & OHP, and 10 lbs/5 kg for squats and deadlifts. Switch to the next set/rep scheme when you cannot complete the total reps:\nT1 Lifts: 5x3 -> 6x2 -> 10x1\nT2 Lifts: 3x10 -> 3x8 -> 3x6",

    routineDescription:
      "GZCLP is the official name for Cody LeFever’s Linear Progression program for beginners.\n\nThe program is relatively simple. Each workout revolves around the big 4 lifts — the squat, the bench press, the deadlift, and the overhead press — and is composed of three types of exercises:\n\nA primary heavy compound lift (the Tier 1 lift) done for 5 sets of 3 reps\nA secondary light compound lift (the Tier 2 lift) done for 3 sets of 10 reps\nTertiary accessory exercises like curls, abs, pulls, etc. (the Tier 3) done for 3 sets of 15 reps\nSee the infographic below for a quick summary of the method, and a detailed explanation afterwards.",

      "This is a very simple and straight hypertrophy workout - just 6 exercises repeated each day, with progression if you hit 13+ reps on the last set (the last set is always AMRAP across all exercises). \nWhy is it called the Golden Six, you ask? Arnold advocated this program for newcomers, centered around six pivotal exercises per session. Its repetitive nature means you’ll have it down pat in no time. And the best part? Its straightforwardness makes it a breeze for beginners to adopt.",

      "Perform three sets for each exercise, with 90 seconds rest in between each set. Do as many repetitions (reps) as possible, but no more than 12, for each set. For exercises that work each side individually (e.g. bent-over rows, lunges) a set counts after you have done both sides, and be sure to do the same number of reps per set on each side. If you are able to perform all three sets for 12 reps then move up to the next available weight on the next workout. ",
